# switcharoo bookmarklet
### Ah, the ol ' bookmarklet to easily switcharoo!

This is a tool to easily create and post a switcharoo to [/r/switcharoo/new](https://www.reddit.com/r/switcharoo/new). It uses api.reddit.com to get the link of the latest post there and inputs it into the comment field, then asks you for some info about the comment chain. It opens a new url, and bam! There's your switcharoo post.

## Usage

Go [here](https://coolreader18.github.io/bookmarklet-loader/?name=Switcharoo&method=github&script=coolreader18%2Fswitcharoo-bookmarklet%2Fswitcharoo.min.js). Then permalink to the comment that you'd like reply to, and click that bookmark. Follow the instructions, and congrats! You've made a switcharoo!
